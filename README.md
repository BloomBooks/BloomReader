# Bloom Reader

[Bloom](http://bloomlibrary.org) is [award-winning](http://allchildrenreading.org/sil-international-wins-enabling-writers-prize-for-software-solution-to-childrens-book-shortage/) open source desktop software for Windows and Linux that communities, NGOs, and Education ministries around the world are using to create books in the world's thousands of minority languages. These books are mostly distributed via paper, though some people are making ePUBs. We can now also use SIL's Reading Application Builder to package books as Android apps that can be downloaded from the Play Store.

So what's this "Bloom Reader" about? Bloom users tell us that it's difficult to find ePUB readers that are simple
to use and that can reliably display Bloom books and play audio from Bloom Talking books.
They want the simplicity of apps. But they don't want to have to create apps or have people download
apps for each book that gets published. Instead, they want an app, kind of like a Kindle app, which
people can use to read and share Bloom books.

Bloom Reader is a native java app with a WebView for displaying Bloom books (which are HTML). We want to support the older Android versions and devices that are common in the developing world.

# Distribution

Bloom Reader is distributed through the Google Play Store.
[Try it out](https://play.google.com/store/search?q=%2B%22sil%20international%22%20%2B%22bloom%20reader%22&c=apps).

Apks are also distributed through our [website](https://bloomlibrary.org/page/create/bloom-reader).

# Road map

## Prototype

- [x] Shows a list of books on the device's storage
- [x] User can swipe through pages to read the book

Books get onto the device by plugging into a computer and transferring files over to some known location.

## MVP

- [x] Works well with 3rd party file sharing apps.
- [x] Works with Android 4.4 (KitKat) and up
- [x] Comes with SIL's Andika literacy font
- [x] Book scales to fit device screen
- [x] Bloom desktop Publish tab offers a "Publish to Android Phone" option (Bloom version 4.0). That may have to reduce image resolution.

At this point, literacy projects can seed books into the community and let the community distribute them virally.

## Needed for SIL PNG literacy research project

- [x] Plays talking books
- [x] Book thumbnails

## Tie into BloomLibrary.org

- [x] BloomLibrary.org publishes an [OPDS](http://opds-spec.org/specs/opds-catalog-1-1-20110627/) catalog of all its books.
- [x] User can see a list of all the books in her language that are on [BloomLibrary.org](http://bloomlibrary.org).
- [x] User can preview books, perhaps in a very low-bandwidth form.
- [x] User can choose to download books to her device.
- [ ] User gets notifications when new or updated books are available.

At this point, anyone can publish a book using the existing Bloom mechanism, and have it immediately downloadable by anyone with Bloom Reader. Books still spread mostly from person to person in expensive internet areas.

## Other things on the radar

- [x] Support Ken Burns animation.
- [x] Support background music that works across pages.
- [x] In-app sharing/synchronization via bluetooth and wifi-direct.

# Building

## Setting up the build environment

1. Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio), the IDE used by the Bloom
   Reader team for developing the app.
2. Install [Open JDK 21](https://www.openlogic.com/openjdk-downloads).  A later version such as the
   one that comes with Android Studio may work, but Open JDK 21 is the most recent one used by Bloom
   Reader team and known to work.  The installation should adjust the PATH environment variable to
   make the java command available and set the JAVA_HOME environment variable.  If not, you need to
   do this yourself.
3. Install [volta](https://docs.volta.sh/guide/getting-started).  This makes yarn available with the
   proper version for BloomReader.
4. Clone the Bloom Reader code onto your local machine using [**git**](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
   as follows. 
```
     git clone https://github.com/BloomBooks/BloomReader
```
   If you clone from a fork of the project, make sure that the fork is up to date with the main
   repository (BloomBooks/BloomReader).
5. Obtain build and runtime dependencies for Bloom Reader as follows.
```
     cd BloomReader/app
     yarn
     cd ..
     ./gradlew copyBloomPlayerAssets
```
6. Start Android Studio and open the Bloom Reader project (BloomReader folder).
7. Invoke the _Sync Project with Gradle Files_ command in the _File_ menu or the corresponding
   button from the command button bar. (This has the effect of limiting the default build
   inside Android Studio to the debug configuration of the alpha flavor of the app, which is
   usually what you want.)
8. Build Bloom Reader with the _Assemble Project_ command in the _Build_ menu or the corresponding
   button from the command button bar. This should complete successfully, running the
   _assembleAlphaDebug_ build.
9. Run the newly built app with the _Run 'app'_ command in the _Run_ menu or the corresponding
   button from the command button bar. This should prompt you to set up an Android device
   emulator. Choose a device and then choose a version of Android to download to use on that
   device. Following all the program prompts, in a few minutes (depending on your internet
   download speed), you should see Bloom Reader running in the device emulator.

   Running the Android device emulator on Linux may require a few more setup steps dealing with
   /dev/kvm: Internet search engines will help with that complication.

## Getting the Bloom Reader code dependencies

BloomReader requires a number of files from the[bloom-player](https://github.com/BloomBooks/bloom-player.git) project. By default,
and in the TeamCity build, these are obtained using yarn from the npm output of bloom-player.

When building locally, if you need to make changes to BloomPlayer, you will currently need to build BloomPlayer first and copy the file over.
It's necessary to do this after running gradlew yarn. Ever after, in the bloom-player project, just do `yarn build4br`. That will copy the needed files to a project named "BloomReader" that is a sibling of bloom-player. If your BloomReader project is elsewhere or named differently, create a junction so that it looks like it is a sibling of bloom-player.

If you don't need to make changes in BloomPlayer, get these files using the following commands:
cd app
yarn
cd ..
./gradlew copyBloomPlayerAssets

If you want the latest version of BloomPlayer, rather than the one active when BloomReader was last
updated, replace "yarn" with "yarn upgrade bloom-player".  You can also edit the app/packages.json
file to update the version number of bloom-reader if needed.

# Signing and Deployment

## Flavors

We build three flavors of the app:

- alpha (`org.sil.bloom.reader.alpha`)
- beta (`org.sil.bloom.reader.beta`)
- production (`org.sil.bloom.reader`)

## Debug builds

Each flavor can also build a debug configuration which appends `.debug` to the package name.
The main reason for this is to prevent debug builds from polluting crash reports. See [https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/64929012](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/64929012).

## Signing a release build

To sign a release build, you need the following file.

    {UserHome}/keystore/keystore_bloom_reader.properties

The contents of this file are:

    storeFile=
    storePassword=
    keyAlias=
    keyPassword=

where `storeFile` is an absolute path to `keystore_bloom_reader.keystore`. This file and the other values must be shared with you by a member of the team who has them.

## TeamCity builds (and deploying to the Play Store)

To publish to the Play Store, we use a gradle plugin: `https://github.com/Triple-T/gradle-play-publisher`. To use the plugin, you must add `serviceAccountJsonFile=` to the `.properties` file described above. Set the value as an absolute path to the `Google Play Android Developer-cf6d1afc73be.json` file which you must obtain from a member of the team.

Gradle tasks which can be called with the plugin include:

- publish{Alpha/Beta/Production}Release
  - pushes both the apk and listing metadata to the Play Store
- publish{Alpha/Beta/Production}ReleaseApk
  - pushes only the apk to the Play Store
- publish{Alpha/Beta/Production}ReleaseListing
  - pushes only the listing metadata to the Play Store

TeamCity builds are configured to publish the alpha, beta, and production flavors to three respective apps on the Play Store.

- The alpha build is a continuous publish to the internal test and alpha tracks of the "BR Alpha" app.
- The beta build is a manual publish to the internal test and beta tracks of the "BR Beta" app.
- The production build is a manual publish to the internal test track of the "Bloom Reader" app. Currently, releases need to be promoted to production manually in the Play Console.

The `ba-bloom-win10` (in the Bloom pool) is currently the only agent configured with the `.properties` file described above.

# Localization

See [./l10n/README.md](l10n/README.md)

# Development

## Testing local BloomLibrary

To test your local BloomLibrary code in Bloom Reader, see the commented `host = "http://` line in `BloomLibraryActivity.java`, `onCreate`.

## Sample book

To update the sample book, _The Moon and the Cap_:

- Open an English collection in the latest version of Bloom. Vernacular and National language should be English.
- Set xMatter to Device.
- Set Enterprise to SIL subscription so we don't lose the quiz pages.
- Create a book using the sample shell.
- Set the layout to Device16x9Portrait.
- Publish -> Bloom Reader
  - Make sure all languages are selected.
    - Unfortunately, this currently means the Tibetan quiz is blank. Not sure what to do about that...
  - Save Bloom Reader File
- Open the .bloompub which is just a .zip archive.
  - Depending on your zip software, you may need to change the file extension from `.bloompub` to `.zip` to do so.
- Pull the `meta.json` file out of the archive and edit it to include the following line:

  `"brandingProjectName":"Sample-Book",` making sure there is not another line with the same `brandingProjectName` "key".

- Put the modified `meta.json` file back in the `.zip` archive and change the archive's extension back to `.bloompub`.
- Save to {BloomReader}/app/src/main/assets/sample books/The Moon and the Cap.bloompub
