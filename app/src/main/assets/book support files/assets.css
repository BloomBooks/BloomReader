/*
   This rule is poorly placed in this file as it isn't an "asset".
   However, we are trying to retrofit a fix for any existing books which exist, so this is the best place.

   Please do not add rules here, generally.
   Whenever possible, they should go into a common publication stylesheet produced by BloomDesktop.

   We now remove tabindex when we prepare books for Bloom Reader, but we did not always.
   When tabindex is present, tapping on the div causes it to be bordered in orange.
   See BL-6849.
