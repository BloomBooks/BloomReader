Supports newer versions of Android (11+):
- Android 11 no longer allows the user to give permission to access all files, so we had to find new ways to do many things.
"Find Books on this Device" no longer available on Android 11 and later.
New "Open BoomPUB file" command lets you choose a single file to open.
Can function without permission to access all files.
Book collection is no longer shared with Beta and Release versions.
